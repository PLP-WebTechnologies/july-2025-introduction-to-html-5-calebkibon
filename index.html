    <section id="beam">
      <h2>Beam Bridge</h2>
      <p>A beam bridge is the simplest type of bridge, consisting of a horizontal beam supported at each end. It is ideal for short spans and is cost-effective to build.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="truss">
      <h2>Truss Bridge</h2>
      <p>Truss bridges use a triangular framework to distribute loads efficiently. They are commonly used for medium to long spans due to their high strength-to-weight ratio.</p>
      <figure>

    </section>

    <section id="arch">
      <h2>Arch Bridge</h2>
      <p>Arch bridges rely on a curved structure that transfers loads into horizontal thrusts at the supports. They are suitable for locations with solid foundation conditions.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="suspension">
      <h2>Suspension Bridge</h2>
      <p>Suspension bridges use cables suspended between towers to support the deck. They are used for very long spans and are known for their flexibility and elegance.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/suspension bridge.jpg" alt="Suspension bridge with cables hanging between tall towers" width="300" height="250"/>

      </figure>
    </section>

    <section id="cable-stayed">
      <h2>Cable-Stayed Bridge</h2>
      <p>Cable-stayed bridges feature cables connected directly from the tower to the bridge deck. They are structurally efficient and used for medium to long spans.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/cable-stayed bridge.jpg" alt="Cable-stayed bridge with radial cable pattern from towers" width="300" height="250" />

    </section>

    <section id="cantilever">
      <h2>Cantilever Bridge</h2>
      <p>Cantilever bridges are built using projecting beams anchored only at one end. These structures allow construction over obstacles without the need for falsework.</p>
