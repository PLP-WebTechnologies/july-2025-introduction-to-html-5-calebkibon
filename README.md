# HTML5 Basics & Accessibility Challenge: My Semantic Webpage

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a single HTML5 webpage built to solidify my understanding of modern HTML5 structure, web accessibility, and fundamental Search Engine Optimization (SEO) principles. As part of the PLP Academy's July 2025 Cohort, this assignment emphasizes creating a semantically correct and well-structured web page that prioritizes both human readability and machine interpretability.

The goal was to demonstrate thoughtful planning of content hierarchy and robust use of HTML5 elements to ensure the page is discoverable by search engines and navigable by assistive technologies.

## ✨ Key Objectives Achieved

* **HTML5 Semantic Structure:** The page is structured using appropriate HTML5 semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to define clear content areas.
* **Accessibility Enhancements:** Incorporates HTML5 landmarks and attributes (where applicable) to improve navigation and comprehension for users relying on screen readers and other assistive technologies.
* **Basic On-Page SEO:** Emphasizes correct heading tag hierarchy (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), descriptive content, and a clear, crawler-friendly structure to enhance discoverability.
* **Clean & Readable Code:** The HTML is written with readability and maintainability in mind, reflecting a clear code structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Exclusively used for structuring the content of the webpage.
    * **Note:** No CSS or JavaScript was used, strictly adhering to the assignment's guidelines for focusing solely on HTML fundamentals.
